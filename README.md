# Project Name: Portfolio - by and for myself Robin Collins

My first milestone assignment for the code institute is portfolio project using my own work from my previous work 
history within film television and the multimedia industries. It will be a useful landing page after post assessment 
to feature my ongoing working while moving forward in my new chosen career as Full Stack Developer.

### UX. 

Having this website essential for myself offering insight to my style of photography and design I hope that the 
visualisation and cool, soothing colours draws in the potential customer and possibly potential employer.
I did spend a lot of time getting the navigation write and at one stage was coding two nav bars at the same time 
and eventually common sense prevailed and I deleted my first design only because at this stage in the course to make 
my navigation attractive on a phone first when acting in a user responsive feature the hamburger nav menu which I 
had taken from bootstrap source.

### Features. 

My website features a Home, About, Portfolio, Contact and contact Download CV within Navigation. 
It will also have various social media links and additional download option in the footer. 

Existing features are a selection of my photography, graphic and website design from my previous business 
Robin Collins Photography and Rogue Angel images. For reference I deliberately haven’t added a link for Rogue Angel Images 
as the name was slightly misunderstood and the associated email address received a high volume of spam. Therefore, 
offline until further notice and I would like to resurrect it to something one day.

It is a single page website with sticky header and footer so the page can be navigated without having to scroll up 
and down as I wouldn’t want potential customer of client clicking on an alternate website before they have does 
what was intended.

Additional plans for this website future post assessment is to have the page scroll up better where it looks 
like a roller blind with text content on it then once rolled through reveals a new image in a seamless scroll.  
I used to make similar websites on Adobe Muse, but my extensive research and time limitations have prevented me from 
achieve this at this stage of the project so will save for another time.

Other features for the future would be private galleries for viewing and ordering various services and payment zones 
for contractual works.

When I completed my website for assesment I was constantly thinking of ways to improve what I have I then remembered to add a favicon
using my RNC Media logo and think small touches like this make all the difference to how much more professional a website looks.
 
### Technologies Used. 

I used bootstrap technologies for this assignment. I also used Google Fonts, Font Awesome and Hover.css. 
In addition to these I used Balsamiq for my frameworks

### Testing.

I struggled for some time with the concepts behind Bootstrap but began to find it an extremely powerful tool. 

Once I started to read more material and watch YouTube videos it started to make a lot more sense and 
I’m still reading and find more insightful information.

I still not sure I have managed to get the H2 to arrange itself quite how I would like to view it on 
a medium format however not unsightly by any means.

I relied heavily on the use of the google inspect feature to work closely with it just to identify 
the various CSS elements that require amendment.

In the early stages I found I would be taking two steps forward and one step back. Unfortunately, there were 
even occasions where I take more coding steps backward rather than forward.

I started using transitions with Background images and decided not to use them because the transition area so 
large it didn’t transcend how I expected and even effected the text areas.

I probably spent the longest period of time trying to fathom why the Burger Navigation style was so difficult I found 
myself looking in the right place but getting it to work took a few extra nudges in the right direction from a tutor. 

I have defiantly come to an understanding that there can come a point where the brain requires rest and a break can 
make the world of difference to when It comes to grasping a concept or two.

With my fast approaching my deadline for at least a day I was confused by a lack of positive responsive behaviour 
on my mobile and tablet views when using the google inspect feature. As a stroke of luck, I solved this by suddenly 
remembering col-xs (Bootstrap Extra small) references and thankfully I could relax as this solved my problem in this area. 

Furthermore, I think this was helped I believe when I discovered an additional bracket had been deleted in error at some 
stage within my media query.

What I have had issues with is I've had to clear Google Cache after almost every design alteration. This could result in me 
thinking something is'nt working and I will go back now and again losing time.

During the testing my most difficult problem came at the end when I couldn't get the Header, Navigation and Background images
wouldn't display correctly on smaller devices. I at the stage of this have accepted I failed to fix this correctly from a developers
point of view however visually I did achieve the look I required. However I am disapointed as I have worked hard on this assignment but
felt perefection slip towards the end. I don't like defeat so it will definatlely be a priority to resolve this issue. Once I have been
assessed. 

I'm not sure if this had been made worse having to clear my google inspect cashe after every implimented change.

At this stage I also had issues with the portfolio displaying two smaller images on the smaller displays to utilise space made available
with the Bootstrap colomns but also proved to be difficult to execute. I managed it on medium sized screens with media quieries.


### Deployment. 

 I followed the course setting up the a GitHub account in October 2019 I cannot remember the process but it was very 
 straight forward. In doing this I then linked it to my google browser short cut for GitPod. 

I then once on Gitpod use the command using the workspace section of the screen to set up a new repository which allows 
me to back up my work. I do this by typing in server language which is all I know it as at this stage of my project. 

 git init  

Is what is typed in first. I then proceed in adding folders on the right side of the workspace either right click with 
the mouse and select new folder or go to file at the top of the page and click, file, then click new folder.

An assets folder is devised in that folder additional folders are added CSS and images. I also added CV to store 
my curriculum Vitae (C.V) and at the stages of completing this README file I added the design folder which holds the 
wireframes design for this website.

A file was made for the HTML5 index page and a CSS3 file which is stored into the CSS folder.

Every time I did a Signiant amount of work or large change and generally at the end of a day I would commit my work 
to my GitHub Repository.

Using the commands as follows on the Workspace area:

git status

A status would be given.

git add .

Nothing appears to happen but every-time I didn’t use this particular command my git wound not commit.

Next command would be:

git commit -m “I would always add a comment hear describing alterations and additions”


### Credits. 

Links used (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDpCejbl1sU “How to use the Bootstrap 4 grid - Demo site by Anna Gilhespy”)
 was used as further research on Bootstrap grid system.

Bootstrap – Grid System and Navigation (https://getbootstrap.com/)

I used Balsamiq for frameworks (https://balsamiq.com) 

The code institute course work was also used as reference. In particular Resume project.

#### Content.

There is a small paragraph to describe the role of a Full Stack Developer as take from the W3 Schools website.
 I have arranged it slightly, so it isn’t a blatant copy using enthesis on keywords, these include HTML and Python.
 I have given it a credit link in the credits section.

(https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_fullstack.asp)

The following link is to where I found information for the code to add the Favicon I have now subscribed to his page. Bootstrap 4 Basics Add A Favicon Site Icon by
System 22 IT solutions.

#### Media. 

Photographs used are my own except for the image of myself on the About section which was taken by Spartan race but is me. Their logo is present on the image to credit them and promote them. 

(www.robincollins.co.uk) Is my website for my photography (www.rogueangelimages.com) is currently inactive until further notice.

(https://www.epicactionimagery.com/) Took the image of the Spartan race and permission to use the image is accepted providing the Spartan Race logo is visible.

#### Acknowledgments.

I’d like to acknowledge the code institute as did take a lot of inspiration from the previous assignment and used the previous resume assignment to help me however the website that is my complete
version is completely different to what I started out with and thank fully still looks very similar to my original frameworks design. If there are similarities in the HTML and C.S.S I was mindful 
of trying to keep everything as much my own as physically possible with my limited but definitely expanding abilities. 

The text section on the home page does feature similarities from w3 school’s website descripting the role of a full stack developer.

Literature on (https://stackoverflow.com/) Stack Over flow also prove helpful. I wouldn’t generally get a whole or accurate solution but found it put me on a good path to further my research.

Without sounding big headed I’d like to say I received personal inspiration from myself as I had hit a bit of a low point in my career and rely heavily on a huge amount of creativity and dug down deep and found a guiding force.

I’d like to thank my two mentors for their support and advice Brian Macharia and Akshat Garg. I’d like to further extend that to the majority of the tutors at the code institute.
