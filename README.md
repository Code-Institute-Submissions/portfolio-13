# Project Name: Portfolio - by and for myself Robin Collins

My first milestone assignment for the code institute is portfolio project using my own work from my previous work history within 
film television and the multimedia industries. It will be a useful landing page after post assessment to feature my ongoing working 
while moving forward in my new chosen career as Full Stack Developer.

### UX.

Having this website essential for myself offering insight to my style of photography and design I hope that the visualisation and
cool, soothing colours draws in the potential customer and possibly potential employer.

I did spend a lot of time getting the navigation write and at one stage was coding two nav bars at the same time and eventually common
sense prevailed and I deleted my first design only because at this stage in the course to make my navigation attractive on a phone first 
when acting in a user responsive feature the hamburger nav menu which I had taken from bootstrap source.

### Technologies Used

I used bootstrap technologies for this assignment. I also used Google Fonts, Font Awesome and Hover.css. 
 

### Testing.

Google proved quite problematic having to clear the cache after every implemented change to the web design however 
Developer tools so useful and something I wished I'd been using before The Code Institute reintroduced it to me. 
Currently my menu isn't being displayed where I want to see it as my frameworks design had it on the same row as 
my H1 name heading. I will continue to fix this issue however it is aesthetically pleasing to look at in its current 
form but ideally, I need to utilise the space. Trying this website on smaller screens pointed out that items on my footer 
such as the copyright notice where displayed incorrectly and I will be working to fix this issue. 

### Deployment. 

I used GitHub and GitPod 

### Credits. 

Tutor support where great for little pointers that went along way 

### Content.

### Media. 
Photographs used are my own except for the image of myself on the About section which was taken by Spartan race but is me. 
Their logo is present on the image to credit them and promote them in its own right. 

### Acknowledgments. 

I’d like to acknowledge the code institute as did take a lot of inspiration from the previous assignment and used 
the previous resume assignment to help me however the website that is my complete version is completely different 
to what I started out with and thank fully and not a million miles away from my original frameworks design. If there are 
similarities in the HTML and C.S.S I was mindful of trying to keep everything as much my own as physically possible 
with my limited but definitely expanding abilities. 

The text section on the home page does feature similarities from w3 school’s website descripting the role of a full stack developer.
