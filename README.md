### Technologies Used.

I used bootstrap technologies for this assignement.
I also used Google Fonts, Font Awesome and Hover.css.

### Testing.

Google proved quite problematic having to clear the cache after every implimented change to the webdesign however 
Delveloper tools so useful and something I wished I'd been using before The Code Institute reintroduced it to me.

Currenty my menu isn't being displayed where I want to see it as my frameworks design had it on the same row as my H1 name heading.
I will continue to fix this issue however it is asthetically pleasing to look at in its current form but ideally I need to utalise 
the space.

Trying this website on smaller screens pointed out that items on my footer such as the copyright notice where displayed
incorrectly and I will be working to fix this issue.

### Deployment.

I used GitHub and GitPod

### Credits.

Tutor support where great for little pointers that went along way

### Content.

### Media.

Photographs used are my own except for the image of myself on the About section which was taken by Spartan race.
Their logo is present on the image to credit them and promte them in its own right.

### Acknowledgments.

I acknowlege the code institute as did take a lot of inspiration from the previous assignment and used the previous resume 
assignment to help me. Therefore there will be simularities in the HTML and CSS. I kept mindful of trying to keep everything
as much my own as physically possible with my abilities.

My colour theme is if you haven't guessed inspired by Superman.
