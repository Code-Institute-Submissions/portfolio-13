# Project Name: Portfolio - by and for myself Robin Collins

My first milestone assignment for the code institute is portfolio project using my own work from my previous work 
history within film television and the multimedia industries. It will be a useful landing page after post assessment 
to feature my ongoing working while moving forward in my new chosen career as Full Stack Developer.

### UX. 

Having this website essential for myself offering insight to my style of photography and design I hope that the 
visualisation and cool, soothing colours draws in the potential customer and possibly potential employer.
I did spend a lot of time getting the navigation write and at one stage was coding two nav bars at the same time 
and eventually common sense prevailed and I deleted my first design only because at this stage in the course to make 
my navigation attractive on a phone first when acting in a user responsive feature the hamburger nav menu which I 
had taken from bootstrap source.

### Features. 

My website features a Home, About, Portfolio, Contact and contact Download CV within Navigation. 
It will also have various social media links and additional download option in the footer. 

Existing features are a selection of my photography, graphic and website design from my previous business 
Robin Collins Photography and Rogue Angel images. For reference I deliberately haven’t added a link for Rogue Angel Images 
as the name was slightly misunderstood and the associated email address received a high volume of spam. Therefore, 
offline until further notice and I would like to resurrect it to something one day.

It is a single page website with sticky header and footer so the page can be navigated without having to scroll up 
and down as I wouldn’t want potential customer of client clicking on an alternate website before they have does 
what was intended.

Additional plans for this website future post assessment is to have the page scroll up better where it looks 
like a roller blind with text content on it then once rolled through reveals a new image in a seamless scroll.  
I used to make similar websites on Adobe Muse, but my extensive research and time limitations have prevented me from 
achieve this at this stage of the project so will save for another time.

Other features for the future would be private galleries for viewing and ordering various services and payment zones 
for contractual works.
 
### Technologies Used. 

I used bootstrap technologies for this assignment. I also used Google Fonts, Font Awesome and Hover.css. 
In addition to these I used Balsamiq for my frameworks

### Testing.

I struggled for some time with the concepts behind Bootstrap but began to find it an extremely powerful tool. 

Once I started to read more material and watch YouTube videos it started to make a lot more sense and 
I’m still reading and find more insightful information.

I still not sure I have managed to get the H2 to arrange itself quite how I would like to view it on 
a medium format however not unsightly by any means.

I relied heavily on the use of the google inspect feature to work closely with it just to identify 
the various CSS elements that require amendment.

In the early stages I found I would be taking two steps forward and one step back. Unfortunately, there were 
even occasions where I take more coding steps backward rather than forward.


### Deployment. 

To be completed the evening 06/02/20 

### Credits. 

Links used (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDpCejbl1sU “How to use the Bootstrap 4 grid - Demo site by Anna Gilhespy”)
 was used as further research on Bootstrap grid system.

Bootstrap – Grid System and Navigation (https://getbootstrap.com/)

I used Balsamiq for frameworks (https://balsamiq.com) 

The code institute course work was also used as reference. In particular Resume project.

#### Content.

There is a small paragraph to describe the role of a Full Stack Developer as take from the W3 Schools website.
 I have arranged it slightly, so it isn’t a blatant copy using enthesis on keywords, these include HTML and Python.
 I have given it a credit link in the credits section.

#### Media. 

Photographs used are my own except for the image of myself on the About section which was taken by Spartan race but is me. Their logo is present on the image to credit them and promote them. 

(www.robincollins.co.uk) Is my website for my photography (www.rogueangelimages.com) is currently inactive until further notice.

(https://www.epicactionimagery.com/) Took the image of the Spartan race and permission to use the image is accepted providing the Spartan Race logo is visible.

#### Acknowledgments.

I’d like to acknowledge the code institute as did take a lot of inspiration from the previous assignment and used the previous resume assignment to help me however the website that is my complete version is completely different to what I started out with and thank fully still looks very similar to my original frameworks design. If there are similarities in the HTML and C.S.S I was mindful of trying to keep everything as much my own as physically possible with my limited but definitely expanding abilities. 

The text section on the home page does feature similarities from w3 school’s website descripting the role of a full stack developer.

Without sounding big headed I’d like to say I received personal inspiration from myself as I had hit a bit of a low point in my career and rely heavily on a huge amount of creativity and dug down deep and found a guiding force.

I’d like to thank my two mentors for their support and advice Brian Macharia and Akshat Garg. I’d like to further extend that to the tutors at the code institute.
