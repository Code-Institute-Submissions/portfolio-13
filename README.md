Notes to fullfil above headings.
15/01/20 I have my idea in place but have found it difficult where to start
therefore I have been getting ideas from the previous assignment from the 
course to remind me of the proceedures in creating a website therefore there
might be some similarities at the begining of this assignment. However I intend
to impliment changes once I see my design come through and to life.

Changed Navigation colours to break the look of the tabs as one red bar didn't give a clear break.

My colour theme is if you haven't guessed inspired by Superman.
